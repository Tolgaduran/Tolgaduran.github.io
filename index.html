  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>Hi, im Tolga and I am aspire to be a specialist in cyber security.</p>
  <h3>What is the purpose of this website</h3>
    <p>
      On this website you will find a collection of projects and skills that I have honed over my years studying in my degree. 
      My future plans for this website would be to make it into a platform where I can inspire others with my own journey into Info Tech.
    </p>
  <h3>What started the Journey?</h3>
    <p>
      I have always been a computer nerd since I can remember and over the years it has bloomed into my choice of carrer. 
      I constantly try and set goals for myself to strive towards to constantly learn as much as I possibly can and hopefully apply that 
      knowledge into the industry or my own projects.

    <h3>PROJECTS/TOOLS</h3>
      <h4>Visualisation on Migration due to Climate Change</h4>
        <p>My partner and I were able to represent data on climate change migration and follow Data Visualisation techniques using a choropleth which we made using the D3 library.</p>
        <a class="btn" href="VisualisationWebsite/Vis.html" target="_blank">Data Visualisation</a>
      <h4>Web Application Firewall</h4>
        <p>This was my final year project, we managed to build a web application firewall. We demonstrated the functionality through a vulnerable web application created by WebGoat!</p>
        <a class="btn" href="https://github.com/Da2MinuteNoodle/MaxSecurityWAF" target="_blank">Download Web Application Firewall</a>

    <h3>SWINBBURNE PROJECTS/PAPERS</h3>
      <h4>Robot Pathfinder</h4>
        <p>CLI tool created in C#. Within it you specify a start and a goal state, and map out walls in a .txt file. Once done the pathfinder will find a path to the speficied state using any of the following algorithms</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Breath First Search</li>
          <li>Depth First Search</li>
          <li>Greedy Breath First Search</li>
          <li>A Star Algorthm</li>
          <li>2 custom algorithms: Depth First Limited Search, A Star Limited Search</li>
        </ul>

      <h4>Inference Engine</h4>
        <p>Solves Horn Clauses. Dont really know exactly why that is important, but it was pretty hard to code.</p>
        <p>Clauses can be solved using:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Truth Table</li>
          <li>Foward Chaining</li>
          <li>Backward Chaining</li>
        </ul>
        <a class="btn" href="https://github.com/Tolgaduran/InferenceEngine" target="_blank">Inference Engine</a>
      <h4>My Literature Review on Advanced Persistant Threats</h4>
        <p>This is a paper that I am very proud of and I believe it gives amazing insight into the complexities of Advanced Persistant Threats and how attacks are evolving in ways that are more subtle and hard to detect</p>

    <h3>OTHER</h3>
      <h4>John The Ripper Password Cracking</h4>
        <p>I used a tool within Kali Linux to crack simple and complex winzip passwords and documented my findings</p>

      <h4>Creating a personal Network Attached Storage for Home Use</h4>
        <p>I used an old PC that I had found lying around to build a working NAS</p>
        <a class="btn" href="NAS/NAS.html" target="_blank">Installing NAS</a>
      <h4>USB rubber ducky - using regular USB</h4>
        <p>Windows no longer allows autorun functions on USB devices for obvious reasons, therefore no longer works</p>
